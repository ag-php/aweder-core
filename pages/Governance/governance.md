# Mission Statement

At Awe-der, we believe in our free, no hassle platform that will allow small businesses to take control of online orders.

No costs, no cuts, no middlemen. Here at Awe-der we believe in giving back, and allowing small businesses to transition to online ordering and contactless table ordering, with a no hassle simple to use platform.

Awe-der core is a maintained Open Source project with defined standards and tooling,, and always will be - no vendor lock-in, no 3rd party proprietary code.


# Leadership

Awe-der core uses the BDFL (Benovolent Dictator for Life) model for leadership.

This means that the core maintenance of this software, decisions on RFC's
(Request for Change), feature request handling, code merges and all Governence decisions
are handled by the declared BDFL which is the team at:

Jump Twenty-Four Ltd.
Second Floor,
Lambourne's Great Hampton Works,
Great Hampton Row,
Birmingham,
West Midlands,
B19 3JP.

# Communication

Every decision that is the result of a Pull Request, the handling of issue reporting and
the discussion of a feature or roadmap decision will be communicated clearly and in accordance to
the Code of Conduct.

# BDFL usage

The core team at Jump Twenty Four Ltd. maintains the project as Open Source Software (OSS).

out in this document. Maintainers are elected by the BDFL body.

#### Committer
Any member of the community that has a Pull Request merged into the core can automatically

# Workflow & Tooling

### Workflow

The project uses the following branch folder structure:
* `/feature/*`
* `/hotfix/*`
* `/release/*`

If the branch relates to an Issue or Feature request, it must contain the ticket
reference in the branch name.

Each PR must be approved by 2 different core maintainers and must pass all unit tests
before it can be merged.

### Tooling

Awe-der is designed to run on any cloud platform provider, and as such is permitted to
contain cloud config markup in the root.

Awe-der is designed to be run locally with Docker. Any changes must comply with the
ability to run the application locally with docker-compose.
